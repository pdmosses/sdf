# SDF3 â€“ Syntax Definition Formalism

> [SDF3] is the third version of the _Syntax Definition Formalism_ meta-language in [Spoofax]
for defining the syntax of a language,
which is used for both parsing an input into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST),
and to provide syntax highlighting.

> Through the use of _templates_,
SDF3 can also be used to define a pretty-printer.

SDF3 was originally called "The Template Language".

This example demonstrates generation of a hyperlinked twin from a _bootstrapped_ meta-language definition:
the syntax of SDF3 is defined in SDF3 itself.

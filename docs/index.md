> Work in progress!!!

This website is to be a _hyperlinked twin_ of the [SDF repo],
which is used by the [Spoofax language workbench][Spoofax].
It will facilitate online code navigation by enhancing the raw code from the repo with syntax-based highlighting,
and with hyperlinks between declarations of and references to names.
Both the highlighting and the hyperlinks will be based on the metadata used by Spoofax .

Spoofax is to generate the sources of the webpages from raw files in the SDF3 metalanguage:

- `docs/TemplateLang/syntax/DIR/FILE.sdf3.md` is to be generated from `metaborg/sdf/org.metaborg.meta.lang.template/syntax/DIR/FILE.sdf3`
- `docs/TemplateLang/syntax/DIR/.pages` is to be generated from `metaborg/sdf/org.metaborg.meta.lang.template/syntax/DIR/`

The [Material for MkDocs] theme generates the website from the Markdown source files.

The [mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin]
generates the directory titles in the navigation from the settings in the `.pages` files,
overriding the titles generated by MkDocs.[^mkdocs-issue]
